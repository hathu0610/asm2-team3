I have had a wonderful time for almost 3 years studying and also working in the US. Due to the spread of Covid in the US, it is a challenge for me to complete my Bachelor’s degree in America so RMIT University is the next path I chose to continue my study. I will graduate from RMIT in semester A, 2022, and during the time studying here, I have explored, experienced, and learned various things, especially receiving an opportunity to become a human resource executive in RMIT Tourism and Hospitality Club. This club organizes many traveling trips for club members and traveling is also one of my top hobbies which appeals to me staying in this club longer. I do not have any experience in the IT field as my major is an international business, but after having a bad experience with the intrusion of num virus blackmail a few months ago which make all of my files in the C drive on my laptop hardly damaged. It is a reason why I want to take an IT course to understand more about the basic IT skills to tackle the virus incursion in the future and also to support my future career.</h5>

          <h5>I am Nguyen Nhat Hoang (s3926555), a first-year student at RMIT Vietnam. Playing team sports and developing new skills are my most treasured pastimes. I can spend weeks practicing the same basketball move until I have completely mastered it. In 2007, my family moved from a small city to Hanoi for better education opportunities for my elder sister and I. Ten years later, still for the sake of knowledge, I embarked on a journey to the United States for high school. Not only did I get my diploma, but I also formed close-knit friendships in the US and met an important mentor. Through a Computer Science class in high school, he introduced me to the basic concepts of programming and challenged me with nerve-racking coding problems that would take days, even weeks, to crack. Oddly enough, the more I dived into these problems, the more intrigued I became. I soon realized the correlation between math, my favorite subject, and the science behind the latest technologies. This is when I know that I am seeking a career in Information Technology. Returning home amid the first COVID-19 outbreak, I took some time reflecting on myself and started an apprenticeship at Pancake Vietnam. During these 8 months, I have gained rather precious knowledge about Flutter and Phoenix frameworks that Pancake uses to build their enterprise chatting app. What todays' computers can do is unimaginable 30 years ago, yet, I believe Artificial Intelligence can greatly elevate computers. The unrealized full capability of computers inspired me to learn, understand, and apply Artificial Intelligence in my future career.</h5>

            <h5>My name is Nguyen Thi Ha Thu (s3927104), a first-year student at RMIT Vietnam. My journey into technology began when I first started university in the US working on my major in economics. As I was taking my fundamental classes, I learned Computer Science 101 and met a teacher who had a deep passion for tech and aspired to pass on his passion to his students - including me. He viewed coding as ‘mysteries', and we - the coder - were the “detective" who needed to solve those mysteries. In the summer of my second year, I was lucky enough to get a job at a game studio where I joined as a Game Developer Intern. I had a wonderful experience with my team as well as being mentored by my dedicated Tech Lead. In contrast to what I hoped, I did not feel satisfied and enjoyable while being a Developer and decided to take a gap year. Coming back to Viet Nam, I found a suitable job that combines my passion for Tech with my capability in Analysis/Operation - to work as a Product Owner for an e-commerce company. I noticed that due to a lack in my knowledge about Tech, this created a gap between me and the Tech team since my job heavily involves working between Developers, Designers, and the Business team. I decided to continue my learning journey at RMIT since RMIT has the best education quality with an English-speaking environment. I believe that RMIT will equip me with enough knowledge for my future job and learn about how technology will change in the future. </h5>

My enthusiasm for IT can be attributed to my father who is a big influence in my life and introduced me to the world of technology. Ever since my dad taught me the limitless potential of technology, I have studied programming and contributed to some of the small projects for the modding communities of some games. Nowadays, I devote my time to studying and coding in python to aid me in achieving my little ambition: to create my own virtual personal assistant. In fact, recently, I was able to code a simple chatbot to take orders and services for a simple coffee shop using python. Despite having a rich background in IT, my interests are not only limited to technology but I also have a deep passion for art and basketball. As a matter of fact, before applying to study for a degree in IT, I was considering whether to pursue an art career. However, I decided to channel my passion and creativity in the art to further support me on the road to becoming an IT professional. Furthermore, by studying RMIT, I am confident that by studying in this unique and international environment, I will be able to further develop myself in many ways that I can’t think of.</h5>

      <h3>Comparison</h3>  
      <h5>While Hoang Anh, Hoang, and Thu are extroverts, Kien is an introvert; his introversion helps synergize the other members, creating a harmonious team. All four members hold qualities of creative and accommodating minds that are of great use when brainstorming practical solutions to users' problems. Everyone is eminently skillful at working in a team, some even perform best when they are within a team. Half of the team - Thu and Kien - are prone to a dynamic, unstructured working environment, but the other half - Hoang Anh and Hoang rather favor a structured, coherent one. This is an even combination that will create a punctual, highly productive team, yet not lacking the fun and spontaneity. While Kien and Thu are looking for a purpose in the workplace, Hoang Anh, a natural-born leader, is great at giving people a sense of purpose at work. This is also reflected in the Truity test, where all of us have a high level of Agreeableness (Working well with others) and a high level of Extraversion (taking energy from social situations) except Kien who is more on the Introversion side (prefer solitude). In terms of learning style, Hoang Anh and Thu have a similar learning style, by Audio, Kien prefers learning by Visual, and Hoang primarily learns through tactile encounters. For our career plan, our team members have the same element in which we all want to work in the tech industry, although in different roles. For Hoang Anh, who is more on the business side, she aims for a job Business Program Manager in Microsoft which involves both bits of knowledge in Business and Technology with skills in Project Management and Communications. This is the same with Thu, who is also interested in the position of Product Manager which involves building Digital products. For Kien, he is more interested in an innovation position, where he can constantly involve new ideas in the workplace and tech industry. Hoang is similar in that he is interested in working in the latest technology field, but as an expert in Machine Learning.</h5>

The Product Roadmap mainly includes the product’s strategy, with smaller tactics for each sprint that the teams must complete. To ensure that the teams are following the Product Roadmap properly, each week/month the teams will have an update meeting to check the progress. Occasionally, he attends 2 meetings including the Progress Report of the product weekly and monthly and the Product Roadmap, which take around 2 to 3 hours.

He mainly communicates with clients, the head of directors, my in-house teams, and outsource teams. Since TPBank is a fast-growing bank, it has collaborated with many big corporations and clients. As a result, he often has meetings with those clients in order to understand what they need and their expectations for my teams. After understanding what his clients want, he needs to communicate his client’s needs to his team, including both in-house and outsourced employees. Since many of his projects are simultaneously active, and each of which is of giant scope, his team gets divided into 12 smaller teams consisting of 5 to 7 members each.

With his in-house teams, they have both formal meetings about the team’s progress, as well as casual chats to learn about each other’s lives outside work. It’s not the same with his outsource team since they do not have many opportunities to interact face-to-face and thus, their interactions occur only once a week with formal updates about the outsource team’s working status.               </h5>

Although the goal of the interactions are about gathering feedback from the clients, preparation is a vital part since it shows the clients how professional his companies are. After he receives a problem from the clients, he also makes sure that his team follows up with the clients after the problem is solved. The first few interactions are of vital importance since it could be the foundation for a strong, long-term cooperation.

              <h5>Since he holds the position of Director of Digital Banking Technology at TPBank, he is responsible for attending different meetings with his team to hear reports from recent situations or going to clients’ companies to collaborate with or make a deal with his clients every day. Before Covid, this forced him to spend most of his time on vehicles commuting between different locations to attend various meetings with different people. However, after covid, his face-to-face meetings are changed to online meetings in different channels using Microsoft Team, since offline meetings are restricted and the company’s employees, including his team, are allowed to work hybrid. The restriction acts as a blessing in disguise since later in the interview, he shared that this restriction allows everybody to recognize the benefits of working online through Team, especially when he has multiple meetings to attend to in a day. Not only does this allow the company to save money on commuting expenses but also helps Mr.Truong in saving him a lot of time, allowing him to work more effectively and efficiently. Therefore, because of Covid, nowadays, he spends most of his time in his office dealing with reports and meetings. </h5>

          <div class="accordionItemContent">
            <h5>Surprisingly, according to Mr.Truong, the most challenging aspect of his work is also the most enjoyable aspect for him in his job. He is afraid of how fast technology is evolving every day and worries that one day he isn’t going to catch up with newer and more advanced technologies. However, throughout his IT career, he was constantly assigned and exposed to those newer technologies, making him enjoy working with new and unfamiliar technologies. Looking back at his career, he stated that he had been very lucky since every time he was bored of working with old technology, he would be moved to another department that was researching a new technology with different, exciting teams.

            <h5>Although there may not be any technical issues that require him to personally fix as a manager, he reveals that he uses his expert knowledge and understanding in his IT field to spot out potential issues and simplify IT concepts and give out effective speeches in his meeting with the chief information officer and board of directors, convincing them to use more innovative approaches to current problems inside the company or make benefit changes. An example of this would be when he held a meeting to hear reports from his team and found an irregular pattern within those reports during a system update. When the company's main system undergoes an update, the main system is very unstable which requires much personnel to overwatch it throughout the night to patch or report any issues. Knowing the effect of an unexpected issue during the update, he decided to report this pattern to the chief of information officer and requested the chief to assign more resources to study this pattern while also asking the chief to postpone the update. By pointing out the irregularities and using his own experiences in dealing with new technologies, he convinced the chief of information and got permission to research into this pattern. He and his team found out that this pattern could have caused a major loophole inside the transfer system, potentially causing the leak of thousands of customers’ personal information if left unattended. Therefore, using his adept understanding of his IT field and the necessary caution gained from his IT career, he prevented a major threat that could have happened to the company.

          <h4>a/ The function of blockchain technology</h4>
          <h5>Since trade finance is in high volume and becomes more common as it creates passive income for people, the blockchain technology is originally prevented with the purpose to support participation better during the process of making transactions to peer and peer networks and for furthering the potential applications (PWC 2021). Blockchain is collaborative technology that is not the cure-all, but it is a promising technology that improves directly to the processes of business in organizations, especially the lower cost resulting in higher returns on investment compared to traditional internal investments (PWC 2021). Moreover, the blockchain can be the ideal solution for financial institutions like how they could use blockchain technology to upend everything from clearing and settlement to insurance, financial services, automotive, and voting which currently running and a further update are necessary (Figure 1).</h5>
          <h5>According to Hayes 2021, the implementation and practical application of blockchain technology can increase the efficiency, effectiveness, accuracy, and save cost for the government, business especially plays an important role in the cryptocurrency market. With the large use, it is just a matter of time to see the growth of blockchain technology. The data in 2021 also showed that there are over 10,000 cryptocurrencies that are currently active based on the blockchain concept (Hayes 2021). Indicating from the data of global blockchain development survey for global finance in the upcoming 5 to 10 years (Deloitte 2021), more than 76% of people in executives in the position evaluated that the expectation of digital assets will replace from a solid to fiat currencies (The European Business Review 2021).</h5>            
          <h5>The development of blockchain technology is possible as many active organizations, insurers, regulators, banks, and brokerages are testing various methods to solidify the blockchain’s benefit in real life (Macro 2017). To be more specific, firstly for the trade finance industry, creating smart contracts between parties is what shipping fleets and financial institutions have been appraising with blockchain technology (Kage 2018). Secondly, better custody providers, clearinghouses for the overhaul of the financial market utility also searching at the application of blockchain to many intermediated functions, settlement, clearing, and the spreading of this foundational technology into more mainstream financial market utilities (PWC 2021). The security on the horizon and monitor of blockchain is likely able to be done shortly to serve the best to regulators and also intermediaries press ahead with blockchain projects (Kage 2018). Imagine the growth up of blockchain is the innovative for the specifics of blockchain code toward bigger issues with a distributed ledger world, the multi-blockchain environment between partners of businesses and also the data information on it can be explored to the best version of blockchain supporting the business world through a high standard of technology (Macro 2017).</h5>
        
          <h4>b/ The impact of blockchain technology</h4>
          <h5>Blockchain is not considered a “disruptive” technology that can quickly overwhelm established enterprises by attacking a traditional business model with a lower-cost alternative (Macro 2017). It is a fundamental technology with the ability to develop a new base of economic and social institutions around the world (Kage 2018). Blockchain brings a huge influence, however, to pervade blockchain to economic and social infrastructure can take a longer time due to the steady process of blockchain adoption (Macro 2017).</h5>
          <h5>Since the function of blockchain is to remove the middle transactions, any industries that play a role as intermediaries in transactions such as notaries or title firms that deal with third-party payment processors, certificate services, or the agency company about insurance or real estate and even the bank industry will be affected the most if the blockchain is updated shortly (Macro 2017). On the other hand, Microsoft and IBM which are American multinational technology companies, followed by up to 1500 startup businesses are seeking potential candidates with high interest in blockchain preparing for the industry expansion as well as various alternatives of lucrative careers related to the blockchain (Fares 2019). Specifically, the development of blockchain technology creates multiple career opportunities including blockchain developers, web designers, project managers, or even entry-level and internship positions (Fares 2019).</h5>

          <h4>c/ The effect of blockchain technology on daily life</h4>
          <h5>Blockchain technology affects human life in both positive and negative ways. Thanks to blockchain, the flow of transactions in cryptocurrency is not a challenge anymore and this is considered to be the next-generation business process improvement software and can develop further in financial services. Imagine a world where contracts are incorporated in digital code and stored in transparent, shared databases, safeguarded against deletion, alteration, and revision by using blockchain. Every contract, process, task, and payment would have a digital record and signature that could be identified, validated, stored, and shared in daily life. Lawyers, brokers, and bankers may no longer be required as intermediaries, followed by individuals and companies who would be able to freely transact and engage with one another. However, the update of blockchain can also create a challenge for many family businesses, organizations, and even for future generation careers who work in the third-party position, but the benefits are more than the disadvantages.</h5>

          <h4>a/ The function of chatbot</h4>
          <h5>A chatbot (derived from a "chatbot") is a computer program that simulates a human conversation through voice or text communication (Salesforce 2021). The chatbot’s complexity can range from answering basic questions to virtual assistants that personalise responses as they learn and interact with users more. There are two types of chatbots: Task-oriented chatbots - handle simple questions, business tasks, and data-driven/predictive chatbots - sophisticated predictive analytics that enable personalization (Oracle 2020). Both types involve using NLP, Natural Language Processing in order to understand and talk in human language by text or oral speech with humans. NLP is a branch of AI with an aim to make computers comprehend and speak in the same manners as humans. For NLP to work, it combines rule-based modelling of human language with machine learning models (IBM 2020). To its full potential NLP can receive humans’ voices or text and comprehend our meaning, intent, and even emotion.</h5>
          <h5>The first chatbot started in 1950 when Alan Turing - the father of computer science - came up with a question: “Can machines think” and since then the term “chatbot” was widely known (Adamopoulou 2020). After Turing’s questions, the first chatbot - Eliza - was made by Joseph Weizenbaum in 1966 with a ruled-base mechanism, which is still prevalent in modern days (Daffodil 2019). The next generation of chatbots opened with Perry and A.L.I.C.E in the 1990s, with the chatbot imitating real humans. The history of chatbots turned a new page in the 2000s when Siri and Cortana were introduced as conversational chatbots (Daffodil 2019).          </h5>
          <h5>As helpful as the chatbot may seem, humans might hold a different view of what chatbot is to them. The most prevalent view of chatbots is that they are productivity helpers, while some can be entertainers and companions (Adamopoulou 2020). The companion aspect came into the big picture when according to a study, more than 40% of customers request the businesses’ chatbots to be emotional and can detect humans’ sentiment like real human agents do (Adamopoulou 2020).          </h5>
          <h5>As per Global Market Insights, “The overall market size for chatbots worldwide would be over $1.3 billion by 2024.” (Global Market Insights 2019). As a result, it’s definite that the chatbot industry will witness some changes in the future. The state-of-the-art chatbot technology has many challenges: misunderstanding requests, executing inaccurate commands, and difficulty in understanding accents (Figure 8). In the future, chatbots are predicted to be more humanlike, with growth in NLP’s processing power.</h5>            
        
          <h4>b/ The impact of chatbot</h4>
          <h5>Chatbot adoption is on the rise: since 2018, service organisations have increased their use of chatbots - often powered by artificial intelligence (AI) - by nearly two-thirds (Salesforce 2020). Where there is communication through natural language, there is a possibility for the application of chatbots. Some impacts of chatbots include providing educational content and e-learning practises, 24/7 customer service for e-commerce businesses, and customised health information for patients in health care. With the heavy impact of Covid, B2C and B2B companies are even more prone to apply chatbots, as 73% said it affected the way they interact with customers (FPT AI 2021). The top benefits of chatbots in business include reducing operating costs, improving agency efficiency, and having a deeper understanding of customer needs (FPT AI 2021). In the future, the chatbot is expected to replace menial jobs, especially in the customer service industry. At customer service centres, chatbots work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, while managing many customers at the same time and reducing payroll costs. Although this could result in a massive job loss, new job opportunities in tech areas increase around tech and bot builders. Companies that used to be call-centre with human customer service only see a rise of 15% in pay when they became bot builders (Time 2020).</h5>
          
          <h4>c/ Chatbot's impact on daily life</h4>
          <h5>	Personally, the rise of chatbots has already affected me and I deem that it will have a greater effect in the future. In my daily life, chatbot has assisted in many areas: online shopping, digital banking and education. The most positive encounter I had with chatbots was when my credit card was stolen, I chatted with the bank and the chatbot assisted me to close my card in 5 minutes without me having to contact a human agent. With speech-to-text technology integrated with chatbot, my family members - especially the older generation - will benefit greatly since they are not good with technology and can receive assistance through voice bot/chatbot.

          <h4>a/ The function of AI and machine learning</h4>
          <h5>The concepts of artificial intelligence and machine learning are nothing novel nor new, in fact, the idea can be dated back decades and even before the 20th century. However, the rise of technological advancement over the century gives way to more powerful, flexible, diverse and complex compute resources, especially in the cloud, the volume and accessibility of digital data and the improvements in the performance and complexity of the machine, deep-learning algorithms are the main driving forces that allow for the quick growth of AI and machine learning in the recent decades(451 Research).</h5>          
          <h5>As of right now, with the help from the enormous digital database, both AI and machine learning can be implemented to solve real problems from a variety of different industries: facial recognition for security purposes, spotting spam emails for e-commerce providers, deploying drones to carry out contactless deliveries for online providers, etc (Joshi 2020). For example, one of the main focuses of Amazon when implementing AI into their systems is the search queries. By using an AI, Amazon is able to continuously understand their customers’ preferences and predict their customers’ search queries, therefore, providing a better customer experience by offering coupons that are related for each particular customer. And according to a report by Ekaterina Novoseltsev in 2018, the AI recommendation search engine drove 35% of Amazon’s total sales (Sejuti Das 2020). As for machine learning, it enables ideas like “self-driving car” to become a reality in recent years.</h5>
          <h5>Companies like Tesla create and provide training models for the machine learning algorithm so that the car can identify objects, and respond accurately to the situation while driving, rather than relying on rigid, outdated or inaccurate data on the database. Using algorithms like SIFT (scale-invariant feature transform), AdaBoost, TextonBoost, Histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), YOLO (You Only Look Once), etc, machines can train themselves using fed data to further perfect their systems and thus creating an ideal program for self-driving cars (Mindy News Blog 2020). </h5>
          <h5>Looking at the current state of AI and machine learning, we realize that those technologies are evolving at a rapid rate each year, constantly challenging their limitations and pushing their growth. Especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, when companies are struggling to adapt to online businesses, more and more enterprises are using AI and machine learning to reinforce and help with these changes.</h5>
          <h5>As a result, the term “Federated machine learning” or “Cloud storage” will be more popular and occupy a more major role. The principles and techniques using federated machine learning mean that data no longer needs to be stored in the cloud. Today's devices can store more data than ever before, and probably more than users can produce. As a result, AI models that help to improve personalized services no longer need to rely on corporate servers and can instead reside on the device itself.</h5>
          <h5>Similarly, the techniques used by integrated machine learning provide access to predictive AI models while ensuring that user data is stored on devices rather than servers. Data is also transmitted in a variety of ways. Advanced machine learning models used in federated machine learning keep data in the hands of data owners for greater privacy. This becomes an innovative approach to user privacy and a growing trend. A good example of this is Siri that works on the iPhone but doesn't send all of the user’s data to Apple's servers. Although federated machine learning and its principles are in use today, new commercial applications in this area are expected to emerge soon. For example, the advent of Apple's M1 chip and its industry-leading neural engine are designed specifically for advanced machine learning processes. Federated machine learning will have broader use in the financial services sector in areas such as credit risk prediction, and AI and machine learning applications will drive many other industries as well (Weissgraeber 2021).</h5>
          
          <h4>b/ The impact of AI and machine learning</h4>
          <h5>With rapid development from AI and machine learning, more and more businesses will adopt these new technologies into their systems, thereby automating a lot of the processes and increasing their work efficiency. Moreover, this adaptation isn’t invisible and only exists inside those company's systems but instead, it can be easily seen and observed from our everyday life. For instance, on January 22, 2018, Amazon opened their first Amazon Go store, an automatic and casherless convenience store that lets customers just walk in to grab their groceries and then walk out and be automatically charged for what they bring out of the store. (Wikipedia 2021). Ryan Gross, who lives in Chicago, says that he is lucky to have 4 Amazon Go stores in his area. He describes the Amazon store as a futuristic convenience store where he can simply walk in. grab what he wants, and walk back out. Within minutes after leaving the store, he will receive an accurate receipt for everything that he took. Although the description feels like magic, it is actually the work of a whole lot of innovative machine learning (Gross 2019). In the past decades, the store would have been nothing more than a fantasy or something coming straight out of a sci-fi movie, but instead, it became a reality in this generation. And in the next 2 years, Amazon aggressively promoted Amazon Go and opened 28 more stores located across Seattle, Chicago, San Francisco, London, and New York City, further pushing the accessibility of these future stores for more customers (Wikipedia 2021). While these implementations bring about many benefits and convenience, they are not without any downside, evidently shown in the labor job market. McClelland, the Head of Operations at IoT For Al, reported that a two-year study from McKinsey Global Institute suggested that ‘by 2030, intelligent agents and robots could replace as much as 30 percent of the world’s current human labor’ (McClelland 2020). Although there are more and more jobs created by AI and machine learning, it is impossible to ignore the impact AI and machine learning have on other industries, according to figure 14.</h5>
            
          <h4>c/ Impact of AI and machine learning on daily life</h4>
          <h5>In this technological day and age, it is not uncommon to find kids, adults, even the elderly to have their electronic devices, this applies to me as well. Having some understanding of the IT world, especially with AI and machine learning, I find these changes visible to me and my daily life. About a decade ago, I wouldn’t feel the hassle of being watched every action on the internet. However, in today's world, when searching online using a search engine, with just one simple click on an image, there would be several advertisements showing websites where to buy the product in the image. This is all possible when companies started to implement machine learning algorithms into their systems to detect customer preferences when online surfing. Although the change improves my customer experience when buying online, most of the time, I am very insecure about keeping my personal information private when using the internet. However, there are still some positive impacts of including AI in my everyday life, one of which is a virtual assistant. The assistant I am using is called Google Home and is developed by Google. Ever since having Google Home, I have never felt alone since I can always interact with it to relieve my boredom. Although AI is not polished enough to replace human interaction, it still has been such a big help for me, especially in this pandemic situation. Moreover, with these new technologies, my mother and father would be able to work more effectively using their virtual assistants, which are also tailored to their preferences. There would not be any problem like what to buy for my friends’ birthday since I can look at the data given from the AI to buy their ideal gifts.</h5>

          <h4>a/ Cybersecurity's definition and its functions</h4>
          <h5>Cybersecurity is making sure data, networks, and devices are not accessed by unauthorized people and so protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information (Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency 2009). Cybersecurity methods are, hence, applied to prevent computers, servers, networks, IT systems from malicious attacks. The reasons behind cyber attacks are various, they can be for financial gains, political information, or just to bring chaos to electronic systems (Kaspersky 2021).</h5>
          <h5>Though there are no absolute solutions to cybersecurity and maintaining privacy, there are ways for people to better secure their online information. For personal security, conjoining individual awareness of cyber threats and cybersecurity software will yield the best results when safeguarding information. For businesses, defending against malicious attacks entails a mixture of information safety protocols, advanced technologies, and people’s awareness of information security (Gartner n.d).</h5>          
          <h5>As people move all of their data into the cloud in the work-from-home era, securing all of this data surely requires inconvenient multi-factor authentication. This explains the mass penetration of hackers into users' information as they use similar passwords across different sites for ease of access (Vizard, M 2021). Over the years, especially in such a rapid growth of IT operations, attackers are becoming more sophisticated with their technology, presenting a dire need for advanced cybersecurity. Technology such as Deepfakes, enhanced by Artificial Intelligence, can compromise even the most advanced systems (Help Net Security 2021). 5G is another considerably dangerous technology. With such an upsurge in download speed, hackers are capable of finding loopholes more easily and launching attacks at a greater scale (Singh 2021). It is clear that there are numerous emerging challenges to cybersecurity in the new era.</h5>
          <h5>Several promising technologies have been introduced, shedding light on how to cope with the globally rising cyber threats. Distributed Ledger Technology presents a solution to the world by safeguarding Internet of Things systems. The applications of this technology are numerous, some of which are to verify transactions, reduce data silos, and improve data confidence (Fulmer 2021). For example, Blockchain, a branch of Distributed Ledger Technology, is taking the technology world by storm, especially in cybersecurity. Its decentralized nature helps systems become harder to penetrate (Singh 2021). In a few years, this technology ‘can be used to develop a standard security protocol, as it is a sounder alternative to end-to-end encryption,’ (Singh 2021), create decentralized administration, develop automatic data storage, which ultimately provides transparent and incorrupt data. Blockchain, therefore, has great potential in reducing cyber vulnerabilities during digital assets’ storing, accessing, and broadcasting.</h5>
          
          <h4>b/ The impact of cybersecurity</h4>
          <h5>According to PurpleSec’s cybersecurity statistics and trends, yearly, ransomware costs businesses around the world over 75 billion dollars (PurpleSec 2021). This data clearly shows how big an influence cyber attacks can have on businesses financially. Attacks aimed for business disruption affect businesses’ operations, in some cases, businesses suffer negligible loss, but in other cases, they might have to deal with grave profit loss. Even if the problem is financially negligible but persists for a long period of time, it is likely that the financial loss eventually amounts to a more significant number.</h5>
          <h5>Beside financial setbacks, malicious cyber access to confidential business information can sabotage businesses’ reputation, leaving enormous, even fatal consequences for them to tackle. Information security gradually gains people’s attention so if a company cannot offer that to their customers, it is likely that they will experience loss of loyal customers, sales, and profit margin (Innefu 2021).</h5>
          <h5>Technology has increasingly gained importance in people’s lives. With such a large amount of data, privacy breaches pose grave danger directly to technology users around the world. While it is clearly not easy for businesses, it is much harder for individuals, who do not have sufficient resources to recover from cyber attacks (ECPI University n.d). Witnessing the detrimental effects of cyber attacks, it is apparent that cybersecurity experts will become some of the most sought-after occupations shortly.</h5>
          
          <h4>c/ Cybersecurity impact on daily life</h4>
          <h5>It must be noted that anyone can be a target of malicious hackers, including myself. I, personally, have had a firsthand experience with an information breach when my social network account was hacked by email Phishing. Fortunately, I was able to regain access to this account and changed my passwords the day after the incident so that no huge repercussions took place. However, I am aware that there are many people, who are not as lucky as I was, suffering from cyber attackers’ activities. Knowing the various methods that hackers can use to retrieve my information and the consequences that follow forces me to educate myself and the people around me about cybersecurity.</h5>
          <h5>Additionally, since it is known that even the largest conglomerates can fall prey to cyber attackers, users must be actively safeguarding their information for their own sake. Once personal information is leaked to the internet, it cannot be undone; that victim may have to deal with scams, identity theft, etc.</h5>

          <h3>1. Overview</h3>
          <h5>The project seeks to help RMIT students, parents, and faculty easily find answers or suggestions for their inquiries about the school through an FAQs chatbot. Instead of roaming the school’s website to try to figure out the answers by themselves, students can now conveniently use the chatbot, available on both Facebook Messenger and the website, to save their time and effort. The premade set of questions and answers is usually detailed and lengthy, as the university tries to provide the most complete answers to students, but the chatbot will summarize and break these answers down so that students and parents receive the quickest, most direct, most helpful responses. Not only will students benefit from this, RMIT staff benefit greatly from this chatbot as well. They may save a lot of resources thanks to the chatbot’s assistance in answering questions, focusing on delivering help, and tackling more difficult, complex questions from the RMIT community. With the help of Rasa Natural Language Processing, our chatbot will stand out in perceiving and clarifying users’ queries.</h5>

There are more than 96,000 RMIT students globally (RMIT University 2021) so the number of questions coming from RMIT newbies and their family, will definitely surge at the beginning of each semester. By helping RMIT services from being overloaded, the FAQ chatbot is an ideal solution that reduces the cost for the school and saves everyone’s time. Statistics clearly show that chatbot implementation is rather beneficial for the university while not compromising overall users’ experience. According to Emilien (2019), there are over 1,200 business schools that have used FAQ chatbots to support students and received 99% of satisfaction from students with 63% of students who would like to experience the further integration of Chatbot into their classes (Nikoletta 2021). Besides, more than 30% of customer service costs are cut by using chatbots (WebsiteBuilder 2021).

      <h3>3. Description</h3>
      <h5>Botto is an advanced chatbot that has artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities whose main function is providing support via major text messaging applications and voice commands (Jake 2020). The detailed description of Botto is divided into three main sections: Botto’s skeleton, extended features, and integration.

        <h3>Botto’s skeleton and its fundamental features</h3>
        <h5>The content of the questions supporting RMIT new students will be set up based on the common questions collected on the RMIT website. For example, “due to the affection of Covid-19, what is the RMIT policy for students to return to campus?” RMIT provides many different categories of Frequently Asked Questions, for instance, two of which are “Return to campus” and “Vaccine requirements for students” (RMIT University 2021). Usually, to resolve their concerns, some students will find themselves scouring the school’s website into those FAQs sections, others sending requests to RMIT Connect. Botto chatbot will be the third, more handy source of information that students can turn to. Since RMIT has already prepared comprehensive answers on the website, the Botto chatbot team breaks down and categorizes this information into smaller, more concise responses. With Botto, not only will users receive text responses, but they will also receive visual representations such as photos, maps, videos for further clarification. In addition to responses, Botto’s ability to read users’ intentions is also advanced thanks to the team’s extensive research to enhance Natural Language Understanding technology.
          Botto has a personality unlike any other chatbots available in the market. The process of building Botto’s personality is based on the common qualities between team members (Personal information) which are amiable, polite, and funny. This type of personality can be applied to talk to any group of students at RMIT, keeping the conversation interesting while maintaining a suitable manner for RMIT’s professional working style. A chatbot with adaptable personalities is effective in making students feel more comfortable conversing with the chatbot and learning about the school, thus improving the user experience. Botto reflects the personality of users by imitating students’ characteristics through their chatting style (FPT AI 2020). Students can select at the beginning of their conversation their preferred style of conversation, or Botto can detect their mood and act accordingly later on. Emotions are then displayed visually through chat themes, emojis, and word choice.
           Thirdly, since it is inevitable that Botto will face questions out of its knowledge domain, students will have various alternatives to figure out the answers themselves. Botto will either show suggestions to websites that may contain answers to those questions or a button that requests live agents from RMIT who are capable of tackling more complex inquiries. During those instances, in order to expand Botto’s knowledge, the developer’s team will allow users to give instant feedback and suggest new sets of questions. This feedback is then documented for additional review and implementation.

        <h3>Integration</h3>
        <h5>For a complete experience of the chatbot, it is important that the chatbot can interact with people on different platforms. Especially when Botto is both text-based and voice-based, choosing a channel to run the chatbot on is as crucial as developing features. We believe that Facebook Messenger is the most suitable platform for the initial launch. This channel allows students to interact with Botto conveniently through both the familiar Messenger application and websites thanks to Facebook Messenger Chatbot Plugin for websites (Marketing Legal n.d). There are various reasons that our team chose to link Botto with Facebook Messenger App. The first reason is this app is in the top 10 of the most popular social media platforms that have many active users in 2021 (Statista 2021). Since Facebook is the most popular web application in the world with 2,895 million user access in 2021 (Figure 10), Facebook Messenger is a great means of communicating with students and delivering advertisements to future RMIT students. The second reason is the seamless conversation transfer from Facebook Messenger to RMIT webpage. This flexibility enables a one-stop experience for students and their families. The omnipresence of Messenger is, therefore, not only convenient to keep track of information and data but also easy for students to look up the answer later on (Marketing Legal n.d).</h5>
