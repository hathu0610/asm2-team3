          <h5>My name is Nguyen Thi Ha Thu (s3927104), a first-year student at RMIT Vietnam. My journey into technology began when I first started university in the US working on my major in economics. As I was taking my fundamental classes, I learned Computer Science 101 and met a teacher who had a deep passion for tech and aspired to pass on his passion to his students - including me. He viewed coding as ‘mysteries', and we - the coder - were the “detective" who needed to solve those mysteries. In the summer of my second year, I was lucky enough to get a job at a game studio where I joined as a Game Developer Intern. I had a wonderful experience with my team as well as being mentored by my dedicated Tech Lead. In contrast to what I hoped, I did not feel satisfied and enjoyable while being a Developer and decided to take a gap year. Coming back to Viet Nam, I found a suitable job that combines my passion for Tech with my capability in Analysis/Operation - to work as a Product Owner for an e-commerce company. I noticed that due to a lack in my knowledge about Tech, this created a gap between me and the Tech team since my job heavily involves working between Developers, Designers, and the Business team. I decided to continue my learning journey at RMIT since RMIT has the best education quality with an English-speaking environment. I believe that RMIT will equip me with enough knowledge for my future job and learn about how technology will change in the future. </h5>

      <h3>Comparison</h3>  
      <h5>
        While Hoang Anh, Hoang, and Thu are extroverts, Kien is an introvert; his introversion helps synergize the other members, creating a harmonious team. All four members hold qualities of creative and accommodating minds that are of great use when brainstorming practical solutions to users' problems. Everyone is eminently skillful at working in a team, some even perform best when they are within a team. Half of the team--Thu and Kien--are prone to a dynamic, unstructured working environment, but the other half--Hoang Anh and Hoang--rather favor a structured, coherent one. This is an even combination that will create a punctual, highly productive team, yet not lacking the fun and spontaneity. While Kien and Thu are looking for a purpose in the workplace, Hoang Anh, a natural-born leader, is great at giving people a sense of purpose at work. This is also reflected in the Truity test, where all of us have a high level of Agreeableness (Working well with others) and a high level of Extraversion (taking energy from social situations) except Kien who is more on the Introversion side (prefer solitude). In terms of learning style, Hoang Anh and Thu have a similar learning style, by Audio, Kien prefers learning by Visual, and Hoang primarily learns through tactile encounters. For our career plan, our team members have the same element in which we all want to work in the tech industry, although in different roles. For Hoang Anh, who is more on the business side, she aims for a job Business Program Manager in Microsoft which involves both bits of knowledge in Business and Technology with skills in Project Management and Communications. This is the same with Thu, who is also interested in the position of Product Manager which involves building Digital products. For Kien, he is more interested in an innovation position, where he can constantly involve new ideas in the workplace and tech industry. Hoang is similar in that he is interested in working in the latest technology field, but as an expert in Machine Learning.

          <h4 class="accordionItemHeading">1. IT work task</h4>
          <div class="accordionItemContent">
            <h5>As the head of Director of Digital Banking Technology at TPBank, his day-to-day work involves meetings, long-term planning, and reporting. In the morning, he has a Daily Report Meeting with the Directors and C-Levels about the progress of the projects. After the Report Meeting, he holds his daily stand-up scrum according to agile methodology with his employees about their project progress and see if there are any problems. Stakeholder Meeting is also a vital part of his morning to identify the real problem that needs to be solved. For the rest of the day, he checks the status of the internet and the report about mobile banking to know if there are any bugs that need to be fixed and sends them to his team. With the urgent issue that accidentally occurs in the workplace, an unplanned meeting called Ad Hoc meetings will be scheduled immediately depending on the level situation. </h5>

          <div class="accordionItemContent">
              <h5>He works in the banking industry with many competitive competitors with the recent rise in digital banking improvement. He observes that, contrary to his previous banking company in Europe he worked for, the companies in the same field are not very competitive since each has its own individuality and advantages in the industry, while in Vietnam companies tend to copy each other. These results apply to all of the banking and fintech apps in Vietnam that have similar features even though some users might not need them. </h5>

        <div class="accordionItem close">
          <h4 class="accordionItemHeading">3. Other types of work</h4>
          <div class="accordionItemContent">
            <h5>Other kinds of work he has to do for his job mainly involve building reports: Progress Report and Product Roadmap. As the Director of Digital Banking at TP Bank, his product requires a long-term strategy with clear vision that stakeholders can align the goal when building the product - hence the importance of the Product Roadmap. The Product Roadmap mainly includes the product’s strategy, with smaller tactics for each sprint that the teams must complete. To ensure that the teams are following the Product Roadmap properly, each week/month the teams will have an update meeting to check the progress. Occasionally, he attends 2 meetings including the Progress Report of the product weekly and monthly and the Product Roadmap, which take around 2 to 3 hours. After each meeting, he gathers the information and conducts the progress report for his employers as well as reviewing their working status.            </h5>

          <div class="accordionItemContent">
              <h5>In his job, he has to interact with different kinds of people, especially when his position holds many duties that involve coordination between many teams. He mainly communicates with clients, the head of directors, my in-house teams, and outsource teams. Since TPBank is a fast-growing bank, it has collaborated with many big corporations and clients. As a result, he often has meetings with those clients in order to understand what they need and their expectations for my teams. After understanding what his clients want, he needs to communicate his client’s needs to his team, including both in-house and outsourced employees. Since many of his projects are simultaneously active, and each of which is of giant scope, his team gets divided into 12 smaller teams consisting of 5 to 7 members each.

          <div class="accordionItemContent">
              <h5>As mentioned above, he has to interact with 3 different types of IT professionals: the head of directors, his in-house teams, and the outsource team. With the head of directors, they occasionally have two-way discussions about the future of the product, and debate about which strategies should they implement next. With his in-house teams, they have both formal meetings about the team’s progress, as well as casual chats to learn about each other’s lives outside work. It’s not the same with his outsource team since they do not have many opportunities to interact face-to-face and thus, their interactions occur only once a week with formal updates about the outsource team’s working status.               </h5>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="accordionItem close">
          <h4 class="accordionItemHeading">6. The interactions of the interviewee with clients</h4>
          <div class="accordionItemContent">
              <h5>When interacting with clients, his interaction is strictly professional and the topic of conversations are mainly about their expectations for the project. This can be a great learning opportunity to understand what clients think about the product and what can still be improved. Although the goal of the interactions are about gathering feedback from the clients, preparation is a vital part since it shows the clients how professional his companies are. After he receives a problem from the clients, he also makes sure that his team follows up with the clients after the problem is solved. The first few interactions are of vital importance since it could be the foundation for a strong, long-term cooperation.

              <h5>Since he holds the position of Director of Digital Banking Technology at TPBank, he is responsible for attending different meetings with his team to hear reports from recent situations or going to clients’ companies to collaborate with or make a deal with his clients every day. Before Covid, this forced him to spend most of his time on vehicles commuting between different locations to attend various meetings with different people. However, after covid, his face-to-face meetings are changed to online meetings in different channels using Microsoft Team, since offline meetings are restricted and the company’s employees, including his team, are allowed to work hybrid. The restriction acts as a blessing in disguise since later in the interview, he shared that this restriction allows everybody to recognize the benefits of working online through Team, especially when he has multiple meetings to attend to in a day. Not only does this allow the company to save money on commuting expenses but also helps Mr.Truong in saving him a lot of time, allowing him to work more effectively and efficiently. Therefore, because of Covid, nowadays, he spends most of his time in his office dealing with reports and meetings. </h5>

          <div class="accordionItemContent">
            <h5>Surprisingly, according to Mr.Truong, the most challenging aspect of his work is also the most enjoyable aspect for him in his job. He is afraid of how fast technology is evolving every day and worries that one day he isn’t going to catch up with newer and more advanced technologies. However, throughout his IT career, he was constantly assigned and exposed to those newer technologies, making him enjoy working with new and unfamiliar technologies. Looking back at his career, he stated that he had been very lucky since every time he was bored of working with old technology, he would be moved to another department that was researching a new technology with different, exciting teams.

          </h4>
          <div class="accordionItemContent">
            <h5>Since he is in a manager position of the company, his daily work doesn’t require him to be actively involved in working with the technology but rather checking status from his team and attending meetings for current and future projects. Every morning, he and his team would hold a meeting to discuss current progress in their work and devise a plan to solve issues that they are dealing with. Although there isn’t any technical issue that requires him to personally fix, he uses his personal experience to guide his team when problems relating to the team’s new technology arise, which minimizes the effect of the problems while also providing his team with valuable insight in problem-solving skills. Furthermore, with his abundant knowledge in IT, he would be able to simplify IT concepts and give out effective speeches in his meeting with the chief information officer and board of directors, convincing them to use more innovative approaches to current problems inside the company.
