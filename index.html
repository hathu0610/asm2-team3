          <h5>My name is Nguyen Thi Ha Thu (s3927104), a first-year student at RMIT Vietnam. My journey into technology began when I first started university in the US working on my major in economics. As I was taking my fundamental classes, I learned Computer Science 101 and met a teacher who had a deep passion for tech and aspired to pass on his passion to his students - including me. He viewed coding as ‘mysteries', and we - the coder - were the “detective" who needed to solve those mysteries. In the summer of my second year, I was lucky enough to get a job at a game studio where I joined as a Game Developer Intern. I had a wonderful experience with my team as well as being mentored by my dedicated Tech Lead. In contrast to what I hoped, I did not feel satisfied and enjoyable while being a Developer and decided to take a gap year. Coming back to Viet Nam, I found a suitable job that combines my passion for Tech with my capability in Analysis/Operation - to work as a Product Owner for an e-commerce company. I noticed that due to a lack in my knowledge about Tech, this created a gap between me and the Tech team since my job heavily involves working between Developers, Designers, and the Business team. I decided to continue my learning journey at RMIT since RMIT has the best education quality with an English-speaking environment. I believe that RMIT will equip me with enough knowledge for my future job and learn about how technology will change in the future. </h5>
